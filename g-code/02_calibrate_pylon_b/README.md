# Calibrate printer - Pylon B

This file moves the head to the pylon B and near the glass plate. You should barely fit a paper between the hot end and the glass plate.

Based on the [Calibrating towers to the build plate](http://101user.com/index.php/topic,87.0.html) on [101user forum](http://101user.com).
